# Tree-Dictionary

A simple console application that stores words in a Tree Map and tracks how many occurrences there are. Words can be added from a text file or directly from the console.

### Known Issues

All special characters are striped when a word is entered into the Tree Map, leaving some inconsistences for edge cases. Smarter logic could be applied to better handle this.
